### Naming

- The name AZULI was conceived on 21 Oct 2023 to replace the old name Remilia.
  - Remilia originated from a Re:Zero OC who is the fusion of Rem and Emilia.
  - The new name AZULI with robot-style capitalisation comes from Spanish **azul** (blue) to reflect the robot's blue design.
- "AZULI robot" is also a backronym: Asynchronous Zen Uncommercial Library-supported Integrated robot.
